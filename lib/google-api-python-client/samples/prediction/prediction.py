"""Simple command-line sample for the Google Prediction API

Command-line application that trains on your input data. This sample does
the same thing as the Hello Prediction! example. You might want to run
the setup.sh script to load the sample data to Google Storage.

Usage:
  $ python prediction.py --object_name="bucket/object"

You can also get help on all the command-line flags the program understands
by running:

  $ python prediction.py --help

To get detailed log output run:

  $ python prediction.py --logging_level=DEBUG
