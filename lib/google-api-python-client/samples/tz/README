This is an example program that can run as a power
management hook to set the timezone on the computer
based on the user's location, as determined by Google
Latitude. To use this application you will need Google
Latitude running on a mobile device.

Installation
============
  The google-api-python-client library will need to
be installed.

$ sudo python setup.py install

Then you will need to install the tznever application:

$ sudo cp tznever /usr/sbin/tznever

And then add it in as a power management hook:

$ sudo ln -s /usr/sbin/tznever /etc/pm/sleep.d/45tznever

Once that is done you need to run tznever once from the
the command line to tie it to your Latitude account:

$ sudo tznever

After that, every time your laptop resumes it will
check you Latitude location and set the timezone
accordingly.

TODO
====
1. What about stale Latitude data?
